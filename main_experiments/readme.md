# Main Experiments

This directory contains the implementation and experimental code for the main algorithm across **six key datasets**. The experiments here validate the core contributions and performance benchmarks presented in the associated research work.

## Directory Structure
- `BIQ.py`: Experimental setup and results for BIQ2021 dataset
- `CID.py`: Experimental setup and results for CID dataset
- `HRIQ.py`: Experimental setup and results for HRIQ dataset
- `Koniq10k.py`: Experimental setup and results for Koniq10k dataset
- `LIVEC.py`: Experimental setup and results for LIVE Challenge dataset
- `UHDIQA.py`: Experimental setup and results for UHDIQA dataset

## Key Features
- **Reproducibility**: Each dataset directory includes configuration files to replicate the experiments.
- **Benchmark Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using standard metrics in the field.

## How to Run
To execute experiments on a specific dataset, run:
```bash
python BIQ.py
